lots of math - false

lots of data - true

lots of expensive computers - false

a Phd - false

### 2. Name five areas where deep learning is now best tool in the world

image recognition/classification

image segmentation (is that the same)

NLP - sentiment, chat bot

time series prediction, weather prediction

game theory - go


### 3.  what was first device based on neuron

perceptron

### 4. what are the reqs for parallel distributed networks

my answers borrowed from [Stanford PDP paper](https://stanford.edu/~jlmcc/papers/PDP/Chapter2.pdf "Stanford PDP paper")


A set of processing units

A state of activation

An output function for each unit

A pattern of connectivity among units

A propagation rule for propagating patterns of activities through
the network of connectivities

An activation rule for combining the inputs impinging on a unit
with the current state of that unit to produce a new level of
activation for the unit.

A learning rule whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by
experience

An environment within which the system must operate

### 5. What were the 2 theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of NN

one layer NN were too big and slow to be useful, the addition of layers was needed but hat only became the normal practice within the last decade, due to better hardware and data availability
